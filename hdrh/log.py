'''
A histogram log writer.
A Histogram logs are used to capture full fidelity, per-time-interval
histograms of a recorded value.

For example, a histogram log can be used to capture high fidelity
reaction-time logs for some measured system or subsystem component.
Such a log would capture a full reaction time histogram for each
logged interval, and could be used to later reconstruct a full
HdrHistogram of the measured reaction time behavior for any arbitrary
time range within the log, by adding [only] the relevant interval
histograms.

        Return:
            Returns the destination histogram if an interval line was found with an
            associated start timestamp value that falls between start_time_sec and
            end_time_sec,
            or None if no such interval line is found.
            Upon encountering any unexpected format errors in reading the next
            interval from the file, this method will return None.

            The histogram returned will have it's timestamp set to the absolute
            timestamp calculated from adding the interval's indicated timestamp
            value to the latest [optional] start time found in the log.
